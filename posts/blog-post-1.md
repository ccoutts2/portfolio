Today marks the end of my first week with Sunderland Software City. It's been a fun week getting to know everyone and getting set up with the tech. The biggest learning curve was learning how to use a Mac! It felt like I had never used or even seen a laptop before. I never thought I would have to read articles on transitioning from Windows to Mac but here we are. I can now safely say I feel comfortable using one, which is good news while I prepare to get stuck into working on projects with Sunderland City Sofware's clients.
